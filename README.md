### Project Description
This project automates the detection of diseases in tomato plants using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By analyzing images of tomato plants, our CNN model can accurately classify them into different disease categories or identify them as healthy. This technology enables early disease detection, helping farmers make informed decisions for effective disease management and improved crop yields.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes a diverse collection of images covering various disease types, plant growth stages, and environmental conditions. The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease).
